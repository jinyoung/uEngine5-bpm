            <p>A license grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use and incorporate the item in your
              personal or commercial projects. If your end product including an item is going to be free to the end user
              then a Single License is what you need. An Extended License is required if the end user must pay to use
              the end product.</p>
            <p class="text-h5">Single Application License</p>
            <p>Your use of the item is restricted to a single application. You may use the item in work which you are
              creating for your own purposes or for your client. You must not incorporate the item in a work which is
              created for redistribution or resale by you or your client. The item may not be redistributed or resold.
              You may not charge users for using your application.</p>
            <p class="text-h5">Extended Application License</p>
            <p>Your use of the item is restricted to a single application. You may use the item in work which you are
              creating for your own purposes or for your clients. You are licensed to use the Item to create one single
              End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the End Product may be Sold and
              users may be charged for using it (e.g. you are building SAAS application).</p>
